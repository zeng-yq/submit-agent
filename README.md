> A browser extension that uses AI to auto-fill product submission forms on directory sites. You provide your product info once; the agent fills every form for you.

---

## The problem

You built an AI product. Now you need people to find it.

Google decides whether to show your site based on how many other sites link to you. A new website has zero links — Google doesn't know you exist. The fix: submit your product to directory sites. Each listing creates a backlink, each backlink builds your authority.

96+ sites accept submissions. Manually filling each form — product name, URL, description, logo, categories — takes 3 to 5 days of copy-paste work.

Submit Agent does this in about 2 hours.

## How it works

1. You fill in your product info once (name, URL, descriptions, logo, social links).
2. You open a submission page — say, [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/submit-tool) or [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/new).
3. Click the extension. The AI reads the page, figures out which fields need what, and fills them in. Descriptions are auto-rewritten so each submission is unique (Google penalizes duplicate content).
4. You review the filled form, then submit it yourself.

The agent never clicks "submit" for you. You stay in control.

## Install

### From release (recommended)

1. Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/submit-agent/releases).
2. Unzip it.
3. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** → select the unzipped folder.
5. Pin the extension from the puzzle icon in the toolbar.

### Build from source

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```

The built extension lands in `extension/.output/chrome-mv3/`. Load that folder as unpacked in Chrome.

## Setup

### 1. Configure the AI model

Click the extension icon → **Settings**.

Submit Agent works with any OpenAI-compatible API. You have four options:

| Provider | What you need |
|----------|--------------|
| **Built-in** | Nothing. Free tier, works out of the box. |
| **OpenAI** | Your API key. Uses `gpt-4o-mini` by default. |
| **DeepSeek** | Your API key. Uses `deepseek-chat` by default. |
| **Custom** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — base URL, model name, and optionally an API key. |

Hit **Test Connection** to verify it works before saving.

### 2. Add your product

First time you open the extension, it asks for your product URL. The AI fetches your site, reads it, and generates a profile: name, tagline, short description, long description, categories. You review and edit, then save.

You can also fill everything manually — click "or fill in manually" to open the full form.

Want to submit multiple products? The dropdown in the top-left corner of the side panel lets you switch between products or add new ones.

## Using the extension

### Method 1: Pick a site from the dashboard

Open the side panel (click the extension icon). You'll see a dashboard with all 96 sites, sorted by DR (Domain Rating — higher means a more valuable backlink). Sites you've already submitted to are tracked.

Click any site → **Start Auto-fill**. The extension opens the submission page and the AI fills the form. When it's done, review and submit.

### Method 2: Fill the current page

Already on a submission page? Click the floating button that appears in the bottom-right corner of any webpage (you can toggle this off in Settings). The agent fills the form on whatever page you're on.

### What the dashboard shows

- **Recommended** — sites you haven't submitted to yet, sorted by DR. Start here.
- **All** — every site in the database, searchable.
- **Done** — sites you've already submitted to or skipped.
- A progress bar showing how many of the 96 sites you've covered.

## Sites database

The full list of 96 submission sites lives in [`sites.json`](sites.json). Each entry includes:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `dr` | Domain Rating (0–100). Higher = more valuable backlink. |
| `link_type` | `dofollow` (real SEO value) or `nofollow` (traffic only). |
| `pricing` | Free, freemium, or paid. |
| `submit_url` | Direct link to the submission form. |
| `submission_method` | How you submit: self-serve form, community post, profile claim, etc. |

Six categories: AI directories, startup directories, review platforms, developer communities, deal platforms, and general SEO directories.

## Development

```bash
cd extension
npm install      # also runs wxt prepare
npm run dev      # launches Chrome with HMR and a persistent profile
npm run build    # production build
npm run zip      # package as .zip for distribution
```

### Tech stack

- **[WXT](https://wxt.dev/)** — browser extension framework (Manifest V3)
- **React 19** + **Tailwind CSS v4** — side panel and options page UI
- **[@page-agent/core](https://github.com/anthropics/page-agent)** — the AI engine that drives DOM analysis and form-filling (Alibaba PageAgent)
- **IndexedDB** — stores product profiles and submission records locally
- **chrome.storage** — persists LLM settings and preferences

### Data flow

```
Side Panel
 → creates SubmitAgent with product data + LLM config
 → agent.execute(task)
 → ReAct loop: observe page → LLM decides action → execute via content script
 → fires events → React updates UI
 → user reviews filled form → submits manually
```

## Tips

- **Submit high-DR sites first.** G2 (92), Crunchbase (91), Product Hunt (91) — one link from these is worth ten from smaller sites.
- **Descriptions are auto-rewritten**, but review them. The AI keeps your key selling points while making each version unique.
- **Prep your assets before starting.** Logo (square + landscape), screenshots, one-liner, founder bio, social links. Having everything ready keeps the momentum going.
- **Verify your backlinks after.** Use [Ahrefs Backlink Checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker) (free tier) to confirm which submissions actually produced dofollow links.
